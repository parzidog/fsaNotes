ExpressJS is a hosting API server.

an API is an aplication programming interface. It exposes one application to another.

SEE GITHUB FOR DEMO CODE!!!

We've seen some more robust use of server-side page generation in this workshop using Express (running on Node.js). Concepts and techs covered include:

    npm init to generate a package.json for a new Node project

    installing Express and Morgan with npm install

    using require to import modules
    
    instantiating a new Express app with express()
    
    Express middleware like Morgan intercepts all requests
    
    registering middleware using app.use
    
    passing control to following middleware using next
    
    starting a server with app.listen
    
    using nodemon and a start script to standardize & streamline dev work
    
    Express routing definitions like app.get and app.post
    
    static routing from a file folder using express.static
    
    dynamic routing using route parameters (req.params)
